                                <h4>A: In most cases you can donate again if you remain free of cancer five years after completing treatment. This is to protect your health by ensuring, as far as possible, that the cancer is gone and will not recur. Five years is the period most often used by doctors to define a cancer as presumed 'cured'. (HOWEVER, if you have a history of diseases such as leukemia or lymphoma, that involve blood, you can never donate again)</h4>
